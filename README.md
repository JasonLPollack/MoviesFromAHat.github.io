# Movies From a Hat

> Movies From a Hat happens roughly once a month.  It's a gathering of Interactive Intelligence in the RTP area to watch a movie selected at random and hangout after office hours. There is an open invitation for all employees to attend. The rules are as follows: 

1. The movie is selected at random just before we watch. No one will know what the selection is until the event.
2. Any movie can be tabled if a majority vote is reached to table.
3. Any movie can be removed from the list if a majority vote is reached to do so.  Only attendees who've seen the movie can vote to remove it from the list.
4. No Troma Films -- Matt Cheely

## Movie Suggestions

Anyone is welcome to offer suggestions for the list.  We're looking for movies that have flown under the radar, not blockbusters. So, "Lord of the Rings" wouldn't be the best choice, but "Krull" is all good. Feel free to open a PR to the movies.json file to contribute, or open an issue on the repository and I'll get it added before the next drawing.
